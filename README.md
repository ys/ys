# 👋🏻

Hey y'all, I am Yannick. I live at the end of the world in Finistère, France.
We live a simple life there and I work remotely, making developers' life easier over LTE.
We moved from a city in Belgium to live closer to nature.

I try to be a kind, genuine and fun person.
I **care about our planet 🌍** and try to live making no harm.
I value honesty and transparency in relationships.
I value **simplicity**, both in life and software.

Ping me if you wanna chat, I would be happy to respond
